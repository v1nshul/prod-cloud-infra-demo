# Production Cloud Infrastructure Demo

A production-ready, cost-minimized reference DevOps project designed for UK startups and SMEs. This project demonstrates CI/CD pipelines, containerized application deployment to AWS, Kubernetes orchestration, and GitOps-style deployments—all optimized for **AWS free tier or near-free tier** while maintaining professional standards.

In this reference setup, staging and production run on the same cluster for cost efficiency. In real client engagements, production would typically run on a separate node or cluster.

##  Project Overview

This project serves as a **reference implementation** for solo DevOps consultants offering CI/CD and cloud infrastructure services. It's designed to:

- **Prove capability**: Demonstrate ability to set up CI/CD, deploy containerized apps, and operate Kubernetes
- **Minimize costs**: Run on AWS free tier or near-free tier (single EC2 instance with k3s)
- **Be practical**: Easy to destroy and recreate, fully documented, suitable as a portfolio demo
- **Solve real problems**: Address common startup infrastructure needs without enterprise complexity

```
In this reference implementation, staging and production environments run as separate Kubernetes namespaces on the same cluster. This design choice is intentional to minimise cost and operational overhead for demos and early-stage startups.

In real client deployments, production would typically run on a separate node or a separate cluster to provide stronger isolation, higher availability, and clearer blast-radius control. This project demonstrates the deployment patterns and workflows, while keeping infrastructure cost low for demonstration purposes.

### Components

1. **Application**: Python FastAPI service with `/health` and `/api/v1/example` endpoints
2. **Container Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) - avoids ECR costs
3. **Infrastructure**: Single EC2 instance (t3.micro or t3.small) running k3s Kubernetes
4. **Kubernetes**: k3s (lightweight, production-ready Kubernetes distribution)
5. **Ingress**: NGINX Ingress Controller (no AWS Load Balancer costs)
6. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing, building, and deployment
7. **Deployment**: Kubernetes manifests with Kustomize for environment-specific configurations
8. **Observability**: Health checks, application logs via `kubectl`

##  Why k3s Instead of EKS?

### Cost Optimization (Primary Reason)

- **No EKS control plane**: Saves ~$73/month (EKS control plane fee)
- **No ALB costs**: NGINX ingress eliminates ~$16/month load balancer fee
- **Single EC2 instance**: t3.micro (free tier eligible) or t3.small (~$15/month)
- **No managed services overhead**: Everything runs on one instance
- **Estimated monthly cost**: **~$10-15/month** (vs ~$105-110/month with EKS)

### Simplicity for Early-Stage Startups

- **Single node**: Perfect for demos, MVPs, and early-stage startups
- **Easy to understand**: One EC2 instance, one Kubernetes cluster
- **Quick setup**: Infrastructure ready in ~5 minutes
- **Easy teardown**: Delete one EC2 instance to remove everything
- **No complex networking**: Simple VPC, public subnet, no NAT Gateway

### Production Readiness (Appropriate Scale)

- **k3s is production-ready**: Used by thousands of organizations
- **Full Kubernetes API**: 100% compatible with standard Kubernetes
- **Containerd runtime**: Industry-standard container runtime
- **NGINX ingress**: Battle-tested ingress controller
- **Perfect for startup scale**: Handles early traffic easily, clear upgrade path

### Why This Architecture is Appropriate

For **early-stage startups and demos**, this architecture is ideal because:

1. **Cost-effective**: Fits within free tier or minimal budget
2. **Sufficient capacity**: Single node can handle significant traffic for early stage
3. **Professional**: Still uses Kubernetes, CI/CD, proper deployment practices
4. **Scalable path**: Easy to migrate to EKS or multi-node k3s when needed
5. **Learning-friendly**: Simpler to understand and troubleshoot
6. **Portable**: k3s knowledge transfers to any Kubernetes environment

**When to upgrade to EKS**:
- Need high availability (multiple nodes/regions)
- Require AWS service integrations (IRSA, etc.)
- Need managed control plane for compliance
- Traffic exceeds single-node capacity
- Team has budget for managed services

##  What Problems Does This Solve?

For **startup founders**, this setup provides:

1. **Automated deployments**: Code changes automatically tested and deployed
2. **Environment separation**: Safe testing in staging before production
3. **Ultra-low costs**: Predictable, minimal AWS costs (~$10-15/month)
4. **Professional infrastructure**: Kubernetes-based without enterprise overhead
5. **Easy maintenance**: Simple architecture, well-documented
6. **Clear upgrade path**: Can migrate to EKS when scale requires it

For **DevOps consultants**, this demonstrates:

1. **Cost awareness**: Infrastructure optimized for startup budgets
2. **Kubernetes proficiency**: Full Kubernetes experience with k3s
3. **CI/CD expertise**: GitHub Actions workflows
4. **Documentation skills**: Clear, client-facing documentation
5. **Practical solutions**: Real-world architecture for real budgets

##  Technology Stack

- **Application**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, Uvicorn
- **Container**: Docker (multi-stage builds)
- **Orchestration**: k3s (lightweight Kubernetes)
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, AWS (VPC, EC2)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Container Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- **Load Balancing**: NGINX Ingress Controller
- **Configuration Management**: Kustomize

##  Cost Estimate

**Monthly AWS costs (approximate)**:
- EC2 t3.micro: **$0/month** (free tier) or t3.small: ~$15/month
- EBS storage (20GB): **$0/month** (free tier) or ~$2/month
- Data transfer: Minimal (~$1-2/month)
- **Total**: **~$0-3/month (free tier)** or **~$15-20/month (t3.small)**

**Comparison to EKS**:
- EKS setup: ~$105-110/month
- **k3s setup: ~$10-15/month**
- **Savings: ~$90-100/month (85-90% reduction)**

##  Documentation

- **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)**: Step-by-step setup and deployment instructions
- **[OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md)**: CI/CD workflows, rollback procedures, troubleshooting
- **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)**: Quick reference for common tasks

##  Security Considerations

- **No hardcoded secrets**: Uses Kubernetes Secrets and GitHub Secrets
- **SSH key management**: Terraform generates and manages SSH keys
- **Non-root containers**: Application runs as non-root user
- **Private container registry**: GHCR with access controls
- **Network isolation**: VPC with security groups
- **Encrypted storage**: EBS volumes encrypted
